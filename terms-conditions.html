                        will be asked to choose how you'd like us to proceed if the team is later than 30
                        minutes. This

                    <h2><span>14</span> Service guarantee & Complaints</h2>
                    <p><strong>General Guarantee:</strong> If you're unhappy with the service, let us know
                        within 48
                        hours, and please provide photos to help us assess the issue. We’ll do everything we can
                        to fix
                        it with a re-clean. If the issue persists, a full refund will be considered depending on
                        the
                        situation. Re-cleans are available on weekdays, except in exceptional cases.</p>
                    <p><strong>Flat Rate Services:</strong> For flat rate services, our guarantee applies only
                        to the
                        tasks and extras that are included in the flat rate service. Any additional services or
                        tasks
                        outside of the agreed scope are not covered by the guarantee.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hourly Services:</strong> For hourly services, our guarantee covers the quality
                        of
                        cleaning, not the number of areas cleaned. If you're moving out, we recommend not
                        choosing
                        hourly services as it’s hard to estimate the time required for such a big task. In these
                        cases,
                        our guarantee won't apply.</p>
                    <p><strong>Move Out Services:</strong> For move-out cleanings, you have up to 7 days to
                        contact our
                        support team if you're unsatisfied. We’ll review your concerns and, if needed, arrange
                        for a
                        re-clean, which will be completed within 7 days.</p>
                    <p><strong>Steam Cleaning:</strong> While our team uses high-tech equipment to clean your
                        carpets
                        and upholstery, we can't guarantee removal of permanent stains or marks. If we’ve done
                        our best
                        with the service, we won’t be able to return for the same issue. However, if there are
                        exceptional circumstances, we’ll be happy to review the situation.</p>
